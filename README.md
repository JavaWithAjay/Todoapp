How It Works
Users can add a task by entering a description and submitting the form.
The task will be displayed in the list below the input form.

Future Improvements
Add a "mark as completed" feature for tasks.
Persist tasks using a database (e.g., MySQL or H2).
Improve the user interface with CSS.
