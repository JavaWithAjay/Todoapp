To-Do App (Spring Boot)
This is a simple To-Do application built using Java and Spring Boot. The app allows users to add, view, their to-do tasks. The app is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

Technologies Used
Java 17 (or your preferred version of Java)
Spring Boot (for the backend)
Maven (for project management and dependency management)
Docker (optional for containerization)
Render (for cloud deployment and you can use also amazon aws heroku etc)

Features
Add tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list.
View tasks: All added tasks are listed in the app.
Dockerized: The app is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
Cloud Deployment: The app can be deployed on Render, a cloud platform.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 17 or higher
Maven (for building the project)
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Git (for cloning the repository)
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/JavaWithAjay/Todoapp.git
cd Todoapp
How to Run Locally
1. With Maven
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Build the project using Maven:

mvn clean package
After building, run the application:

java -jar target/Todoapp.jar
By default, the app will be accessible at:

http://localhost:8080
Running with Docker (Optional)
If you prefer to use Docker to run your app, follow these steps.

1. Build Docker Image
Make sure your Dockerfile is in the root directory of the project.

docker build -t todoapp .
2. Run Docker Container
Run the Docker container:


docker run -p 8080:8080 todoapp
The app will be accessible at:


http://localhost:8080
Deployment on Render
Deploy to Render
You can deploy the To-Do app to Render by following these steps:

Go to the Render Dashboard.
Create a new web service and link it to your GitHub repository.
Select Docker as the deployment environment.
Fill in the following settings:
Build Command:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean package
Start Command:
bash
Copy code
java -jar target/Todoapp.jar
Click "Create Web Service" to deploy the app.
Render will provide you with a public URL once the deployment is successful, and your app will be accessible at:


https://your-app-name.onrender.com
Project Structure
Here is the basic structure of the project:


To-Do App/
│
├── Dockerfile               # Dockerfile for building the Docker image
├── pom.xml                  # Maven project configuration
├── src/                     # Source code directory
│   ├── main/
│   ├── test/
├── target/                  # Generated JAR files (after building with Maven)
├── README.md                # Project documentation

Future Improvements
Database Integration: Add a database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store tasks persistently.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
Task Categories: Add the ability for users to organize tasks into categories (e.g., Work, Personal).
Task Priority: Allow users to set the priority of each task (High, Medium, Low).
Task Deadline: Add the option to set a deadline for each task, and notify users when a deadline is approaching.

Troubleshooting
Error: "No such file or directory": Ensure that the Dockerfile is in the correct location (the root directory).
Error: "Permission Denied": Ensure that the Dockerfile has the correct permissions, and that all required files (like the .jar file) are available.
Error: "Port 8080 is already in use": Ensure that no other process is using port 8080 locally before running the app.
